                Before the modern computer animation, the technique of animation was called traditional, cel or hand-drawn animation. It was the dominant form of animation that appeared in cinemas and movies up until the late 1900s and early 2000s. Traditional animation was much more complex and tedious. You would draw sequences of the animation on to transparent peices of paper using water colors. Then you would take photos of each frames to create the film. Though now with the development of computers and technology, animation has become easier to produce and faster to be mass produced.

              <div class="row col">
                Another development of animation was the transition from 2D animation to 3D animation. The difference between the two animation types were that in 2D animation, artists would draw every frame while in 3D animation, you would create a 3D model of each part of the scene to make the animation "pop out" more. Even though animation was harder to animation, it was more expressive in the emotions and textures it can show. Many additional 3D animation softwares have also been created to make 3D animation easier and more natural.

              <h3>3d Animation Softwares</h3>
              Adobe animation (can also be 2d animation)
              Adboe Animation is an animation software can be fore variety use. You can use it for 2d animation

              Main widespread animation software as you can do many different types of animation on it
              You can do 2d animation just as paper or just general 3d animation using vectors and even characters for video games. You can control the animation very easily and do a variety of things. There are animation software that can do more specific things but adobe animation can do some of the work pretty well.
              Blender
              Many animation studios have specific software that they use for different types of properties such as water or hair
              Splash is used for water animation – able to simulate water in a fictional world and it figures out how water moves in relation to real life. It was used in the movie Moana where the ocean was a character on its own and was helping in the water interacting with the characters
              Tonic and quicksilver was used to animate hair. Tonic was used to group hair pieces together to be able to place the hair in the way they wanted to. Frozen was a movie that used this as Anna and Elsa used Tonic to correctly shape their braids.
              Video for Disney and hair animation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvTchBdrqdw&t=76s
              There are many tools that have been used in studios such as disney that have made animation easier to do but also add new and more dynamic effects such as hair

                <h3>2d animation</h3>
                Toon boom harmony and Moho both focus on 2d animation; Moho focus
                Moho focuses on making animation more easy
                Toon boom harmony focuses are more detailed 2d animation and making the characters appear better

                Tablets and ipads
                You may just used your finger or get an ipad specific stylus
                Animation specific tablets (from companies like wacom)
                Stylus
                Pencil of animation
                Computer Hardware (well enough to run high end animation)
                RAM
                Quad core Processors
                High end Graphics Card
                Storage

                AI animation
                Just like AI art but instead of just one drawing, it might be multiple frames
                You may need one animation to show as a reference for the animation to work
                You can type what you want the animation to go and the AI animation will show a new animation using the characters and scene from your reference animation

                Additional softwares that allows for more details and texture to those of real life
                Software that makes animation so actors don’t need to act out entire thing
                You would only need animators to do the animation

                Auto voice syncing software
                Sometimes animate what the voice actors are saying for the animated character
                Instead, the software will allow you to skip the step and voice sync it for you
